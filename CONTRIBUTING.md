# Contributing
Contributions are appreciated in the form of pull requests. However, to maintain code readability and maintainability, some guidelines have been set. Please do what you can to make sure your code follows the guidelines. *Your pull request will likely be rejected if it does not merge these guidelines, so please read them carefully.*

### Style
* Conditional/loop statements (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.) should always use braces, and the opening brace should be placed on the same line as the statement.
* There should be a space after a conditional/loop statement and before the condition, as well as a space after the condition and before the brace. Example:
  ```javacript
  // Good
  if (condition) {
      ...
  }
  
  // Bad
  if(condition) {
      ...
  }
  
  if(condition){
      ...
  }
  ```
***Always make sure the project is buildable before creating a pull request***
